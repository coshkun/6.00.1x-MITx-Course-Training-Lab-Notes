6.00.1x MITx Course Training &amp; Lab Notes

### 6.00SC can be summarized with these six major topics or objectives:

##### Learning a language for expressing computations—Python
##### Learning about the process of writing and debugging a program
##### Learning about the process of moving from a problem statement to a computational formulation of a method for solving the problem
##### Learning a basic set of "recipes"—algorithms
##### Learning how to use simulations to shed light on problems that don't easily succumb to closed form solutions
##### Learning about how to use computational tools to help model and understand data
